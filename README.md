# Inroduction

Welcome to my first "project". It started as an assignment for one of my classes and helped me get familiarized with python. The class wasn't even about python, it was about programming languages, but our professor at the time wanted to give students who cared enough about coding and the class as a whole some bonus points and so this was the result.

# Purpose

The assignment was fairly simple: **Create a command line PDA system in python**


# TODO
-[x] Translate to english
-[] Add license
-[] Implement main and check for __main__
