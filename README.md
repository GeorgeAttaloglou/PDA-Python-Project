# 📱 PDA System in Python

## Introduction

Welcome to my first **Python project**! This project started as an assignment for one of my programming languages classes. Interestingly, the class itself wasn’t focused on Python, but our professor wanted to offer extra credit by introducing us to different programming paradigms.

This assignment turned out to be a great opportunity to familiarize myself with Python while working on a practical application.

## Purpose

The objective of this project was straightforward:
> **Create a command-line PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) system in Python.**

The PDA system simulates a **basic point-of-sale (POS) system** for managing food orders. Users can:
✔️ **Browse a menu** of food items.
✔️ **Add items to their order** by specifying quantity.
✔️ **View their current order** and total price.
✔️ **Remove items** if needed.
✔️ **Process payments** and calculate change.

## Features

🔹 **Command-line interface** for interaction.
🔹 **Menu display** with item names and prices.
🔹 **Dynamic order management** (add/remove items).
🔹 **Total calculation** with real-time updates.
🔹 **Payment processing** with change calculation.

## How to Run

1️⃣ Make sure you have **Python 3+** installed.
2️⃣ Clone or download this repository.
3️⃣ Run the script using:
    ```bash
    python PDA_Project.py
    ```
4️⃣ Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the PDA system.

## Future Improvements

💡 **Enhance UI** with a graphical interface.
💡 **Add a database** to store order history.
💡 **Implement user authentication** for personalized orders.
💡 **Expand menu functionality** with categories and discounts.
